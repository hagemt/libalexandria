Some Tasks:

* Finish Java skeleton
* Finish Java interface
* Hook up to back-end via JNI
* Conversion FORTRAN <-> C types (esp. arrays)
* Flexible method for invoking models (w/ Android intent?)
* Tests, tests, tests for everything
* Figure out library requirements and add to top CMakeLists.txt

Potential Hooks:

* Check for license on all source files
* Check for tests passing
* Check for updated SLOC count (done, but could be neater?)

Herein, we have a subdirectory for each language that is explicitly bound.
Android code is not here because Android is not a language.
Add directories here for non-auto-generated (non-SWIG) code only.

If you are interested in SWIG, please direct your attention to:
./glue/swig (with headers in: ./include/libalexandria/laX)

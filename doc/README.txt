Don't you love great documentation? 
(or, any documentation) Of course you do!
So, over time, this file should change.

Automated documentation generated here:
*) doxygen (Fortran base, C/C++ bindings)
*) javadoc (Java bindings, android)

A structure of folders, such as: $ ls doc
tutorials topics reference ...
might become ideal, instead.

Remember best practices!

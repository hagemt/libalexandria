libalexandria
=============

This README file contains information regarding libalexandria,
a humorously named for its inclusive breadth of FORTRAN code,
bound using C/C++, all the way "through the ages" into Java,
and further entensible using future interfaces, many and more
of which have even yet to be imagined.

Features
--------

The Library of Alexandria will provide:

* A easy mechanism for any program to produce:
     * Maximum-likelihood estimates in an efficient manner
* Many other planned features, bridging many layers of abstraction

History
-------

libalexandria began in September 2012 as a personal project.
If you contribute to it, you may wish to add your name below.

Building
--------

Currently, libalexandria uses `make`; however, anticipate this
to change as the project evolves, in order to offer broader support.

Developer testing of libalexandria involves:

* gcc
* gfortran
* openjdk

In order to use Eclipse for libalexandria Android development:

 1) Copy or link the files in this directory to your project.
 2) Note the 'jni' tree is empty; it is organized in: ./bindings/java/jni
    The presence of this folder is merely a reminder that the NDK expects it.
    If you configure using CMake, a sample Android.mk will be generated here.
    However you prefer to develop, we want libalexandria to support it.
